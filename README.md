# Techopoly
The main goal of our project is to create a mobile monopoly game. As a kid, many of us have 
played monopoly, which is a game we all know and love. There have been different iterations of 
“mobile” monopoly, but they all involve game pieces, physical money, and a separate board. A 
product that can occupy kids and keep the “mini-van” moms from getting frustrated with their 
children. Therefore we have created Techopoly. Techopoly is a mobile, Louisiana Tech themed 
monopoly. It eliminated the need for pieces and paper money by keeping track of each player, 
their properties, and money values.

We will use a suitcase for portability to allow the Raspberry Pi to display our GUI and the suitcase will alos house our switches as GPIO input.
